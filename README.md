# Learning TDD from obeythetestinggoat.com

This project was created to learn test-driven development (TDD) using Obey The Testing Goat by Harry J.W. Percival.

I decided to use a containerized development environment rather than virtualenv.

To get started, install Docker, clone the repo, and execute compose.sh.
